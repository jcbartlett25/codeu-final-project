# Google CodeU Final Project!

## Final Project for Google's CodeU Program
### Brought to you by:
* Joshua Bartlett
* Carol Soyeun Jung
* Millie Yang

## What on earth is this?
### Well...
* CodeU is an exclusive development program for high potential freshman and sophomore students to strengthen their skills and prepare them to become successful candidates for future technical opportunities.
* This final project serves as the program's last assignment where teams were asked to leverage everything we've learned so far to create something awesome!
* Our project, as it stands is a Wikipedia search engine that can do a couple fun things as well

### What types of fun things?
* NLP!
* A modified TF-IDF page ranking system!

## How do I run this thing?
### Gradle to the rescue!
* Thanks to the awesomeness and simplicity that is gradle, running our project is quick and painless
* All you need to do is make sure you have Java installed, then install [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html "Gradle")
* After that, cd into the root of the project directory and run ```gradle jettyRun``` then head on over to `localhost:8080` on your browser
